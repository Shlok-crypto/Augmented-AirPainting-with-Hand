* **Palm Detection**

To detect **initial hand locations**, we utlize a *single-shot detector model* optimized for mobile real-time uses
Detecting hands is a decidedly complex task: we use model to work across a variety of hand sizes with a large scale span (~20x) relative to the image frame and be able to  detect occluded and self-occluded hands.

* **Hand Landmark Model**

After the palm detection over the whole image our subsequent hand landmark model performs precise keypoint localization of 21 3D hand-knuckle coordinates inside the detected hand regions via regression, that is direct coordinate prediction. The model learns a consistent internal hand pose representation and is robust even to partially visible hands and self-occlusions.
